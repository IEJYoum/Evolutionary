"genetic" code interpreted in python


620 Primes is a manually written "command line" that generates the genetic code for a "lineage" of "organisms" that removes numbers with more than two factors from a list. 

620 BotSim run bots who play the prisoner's dilemma and selects for the best bot type by cloning genomes that call successful bots while keeping the population size in a healthy range.
